This repository contains code used in my studies

Validation: These scripts are used to verify performance against other decoders and performance on other datasets.

MVPA: These scripts are used to develop PSSE, PSSS, PSSEvS, and PSSEaS.

Mediation: These scripts are used to create mediation models.

GLM: These scripts are used to process fmri and build GLM models.

Display: These scripts are used for drawing.

Behavior: These scripts are used to collate and process behavioral data.

Atlas: The brain map used in this study.


# PSSE/PSSS/PSSEvS/PSSEaS

This repository contains code used to devlop and test the PSSE/PSSS/PSSEvS/PSSEaS.

The additional data and thresholded maps are available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PSSES_addition_data_zip/25650696
